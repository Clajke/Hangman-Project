1. Description of project
     What is the aim of the project?
      The project aims to enable the user to play a game of the popular word guessing game Hangman. 
   What does it do?
   The project shows when users have made an incorrect guess, display the letters correctly guessed as well as congruatulate the user for guessing the word. The user can alter the world list to their choosing and the game will continue to work. The game will also show if users have used an incorrect character. 

   What have I learned?
   I have learned how to use code to create an interactive game which utilises definitions, while/if loops and classes to create this piece of working code. When needed I have consulted google for some additional help, such as when I needed guidance about rules within definitions and with constructors such as __init__ or __name__.

2. Installation instructions
   Python is required for this to run, this could be achieve by downloading VSCode as well as the Python extension. This can then be run through the VSCode programme. 

4. Usage instructions
   Please alter the variables in word_list to have the words of your choice. Please run the script and guess the answer and most importantly have fun!

5. File structure
   There are files of milestone_2, milestone_3, milestone_4 and milestone_5 which show different stages and variations of the hangman game. The ReadMe is also here to describe the game.
